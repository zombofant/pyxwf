    Usually, you'll inherit from this baseclass to implement a Crumb. It takes
    two arguments. *site* must be the :class:`~PyXWF.Site.Site` instance to
    which the crumb belongs and *node* must be the :class:`lxml.etree._Element`
    instance which triggered instanciaton of the crumb.

    Note that to create a crumb, you have to use the
    :class:`~PyXWF.Registry.CrumbMeta` metaclass, which requires some
    attributes::

        class SomeFancyCrumb(CrumbBase):

        *parent*. As indicated by the lack of hint on where to insert, an
        implementor of this method *should not* insert the nodes by itself.

        It is perfectly fine (and even recommended) to implement this as a
