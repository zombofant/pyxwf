    """
    Baseclass for a *tree node* in the site tree. Use this to create your own
    site tree plugins. It is highly recommended that you have a look at the
    existing plugins implementation.

    *site* must be a :class:`~PyXWF.Site` instance. *parent* must be a
    :class:`~PyXWF.Nodes.Node` instance (or :data:`None` for the root) which
    is the parent of the node which is to be created.

    *node* may be either a :class:`lxml.etree._Element` instance or
    :data:`None`. This changes the behaviour of the node initialization as
    follows:

    *   If *node* is **not** :data:`None`:

        The attributes ``@id`` (default :data:`None`), ``@name`` (default
        ``""``) and ``@template`` (default :data:`None`) are stored in their
        respective private object attribute.

        The path of the node is calculated by taking the parents path (if any)
        and appending a ``/`` and the nodes name to it.

    *   Otherwise: The private id, name, template and path attributes are
        initialized to :data:`None`.

    To create a node class you have to use the :class:`PyXWF.Registry.NodeMeta`
    class, which requires some attributes::

        class CoolNode(Node):
            __metaclass__ = Registry.NodeMeta

            # list of xml local-names to register for in the above namespace
            # if you don't want to do something fancy, just use ["node"]
            names = ["node"]

            # your methods go here, like so:
            def doGet(self, ctx):
                return self.arbitaryDocument

            requestHandlers = {}
